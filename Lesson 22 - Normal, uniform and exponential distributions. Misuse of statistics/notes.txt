- Normal distribution:
    - can be discribed with just two numbers
        - the mean
        - and the standard deviation
            - represents the statistical dispersion
    - we have the notion of empirical rule
        - 1 standard deviation, 2 standard deviations, 3 standard deviations
        - 68% of the data, 95%, 99.7%

- the game of craps

- more symmetric distributions:
    - Uniform distribution
        - each value in the distribution is equal likely
    - exponential distribution 
        - for instance requests for a web page

- always look at the data, not just the mean and the deviation
- correlation does not imply causation
- careful with non-response bias
    - it means that sometimes the sample is not representative of what
    we thinks it is
- data enhancement:
    - don't read more into the data than it actually implies
    - always place the data in context
