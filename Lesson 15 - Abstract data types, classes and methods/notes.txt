classes:
    - templates for creating instances of a given type
    - in python we can define a class with empty body:
        class xpto:
            pass
    - pass is the keyword to say that the class is unimplemented
    - instances have internal attributes

- shallow equality (is - the object is the same, i.e. points to the same piece of memory)
    - same as object equality
- deep equality (the values, the attributes)
    - same as value equality
- data hiding (a.k.a encapsulation):
    - one can only access instance values through defined methods
    - python doesn't do this
    - but we can adopt some conventions to limit it
        - use _ to "declare" an instance variable as protected
        - use __ to "declare" an instance variable as private
- python also has operator overloading
