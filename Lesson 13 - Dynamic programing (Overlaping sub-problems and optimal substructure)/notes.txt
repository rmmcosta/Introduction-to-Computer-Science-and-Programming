optimal substructure:
    - We can get global optimal solutions with local optimal solutions
    - but not for all problems
- pseudo polynomial algorithm
    - polynomial in the size of the solution
    - running time that is polynomial in numerical value of the input
- polynomial algorithm:
    - polynomial in the size of the inputs

Todo:
    - do the algorithm for the knapsack but
    with the constraint of volume
