optimal substructure:
    - We can get global optimal solutions with local optimal solutions
    - but not for all problems
- pseudo polynomial algorithm
    - polynomial in the size of the solution
    - running time that is polynomial in numerical value of the input
- polynomial algorithm:
    - polynomial in the size of the inputs

Todo:
    - do the algorithm for the knapsack but
    with the constraint of volume 

In Dynamic programing:
    - we trade time for space

- don't be scared with exponential difficult problems
    big o 2^n

- if a problem can be solved with recursion
    - probable it can be solved with dynamic programming

- Apply problem reduction

Modularity:
    - Module
        - collection of related functions
        - functions that belong to modules are referenced
        with '.'
    - Object Oriented programming
        - used with python for data abstractions
        - abstract data types
    - object:
        - collection of data
        - and functions
    - user defined types
    - encapsulation
        - capsules with:
            - data and methods
    - message passing metaphor
        - objects communicate
    - instances
    - class:
        - collection of objects
        - with characteristics in common
