classify simulation models:
    - stochastic vs deterministic
        - in a deterministic simulation we should get the same result every time 
        we run it
    - static vs dynamic
        - in a dynamic situation times plays a role
        and you look at how things evolve over time
            - for example queing network model
                - very important for scheduling and planning
        - in a static simulation there is no issue of time
    - discrete vs continuous

Monte carlo simulations (stochastic, dynamic and discrete):
    - inferential statistics
        - random samples of one population tends to exhibit
        the same properties as the rest of that population
        - Is this true???
        not always :)

- we can use simulations to understand what might happen
but also to understand the current state of the world

-note: python can give us the operating system 
    - by importing os we can know with the name value
    if it's a mac or a posix or a nt
    - and also can give us the platform
    import platform
    platform.system()
        - can give us linux, windows, darwin
