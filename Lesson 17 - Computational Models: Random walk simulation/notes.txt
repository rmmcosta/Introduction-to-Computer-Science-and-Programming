- The way we solve problems with computers can be very different
from the way we solve problems without them
- From now on we will be talking about general techniques to solve 
hard problems using computers
- Learn how to move from an informal problem description
to a more formal/rigorous problem statement

- Learn how to invent computational models
    - model the real world somehow
    - the program is just a mechanism to help us
    understand the world better
    - by doing this we will be dealing with & exploiting randomness
    - we can face/have stochastic processes:
        - processes with a lot of possibilities/outcomes/variables
        - processes sometimes with infinite possibilities/directions
        even though sometimes the initial conditions are known
    - build stochastic models

- making sense of data
- In the a couple of lessons we will be evaluating the quality of answers
    - are our outcomes correct?

- Random walk simulation:
    - Always start with the simple model
    - cartesian coordinates
    - a drunk student
    - he can only go North, South, West, East
    - we need to do a program that simulates a random walk
        - present the coordinates after each run
        - what are the appropriate data abstractions
    - possible classes:
        - Location (coordinates where the person is)
        - Direction (Compass point, for now N,S,E,W)
        - Field (where the locations is represented)
        - Drunk (the person that will move)
    - we can use random.choice from python to choose an element from a list or a tupple

    - in python install the packages with pip
        - for python3: pip3 install -U matplotlab (for example)
