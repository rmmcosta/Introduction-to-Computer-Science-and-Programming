- how many samples do we need to get a correct answer
- how accurate is that answer
- statiscal valid answers are different then correct answers
- what are the best assumptions
- check the answer against the physical reality
- use computers to model the real world
    - data
    - models to explaing the data (at least they claim to do it)
    - consequences that follow from those models

- In this lesson we will simulate the spring behavior:
    - we have the spring constant (tells the stiffness)
    - k=deltaF/deltaX
    - Hooke's law:
        F = -k*x

- real data doesn't fit exctly the experiment
because there is always an error factor
- use linear regression to fit a line to the points
    - we need an objective function that captures the goodness of a fit
        - for example the least squares fit
            - find the line that minimizes the sum of the:
                (observation(i) - prediction(i))²
                - by squaring it we are like taking the absolute value
                - since the error can be minus or plus and so they could cancel 
                each other
                - pylab has a way to do this with polyfit
                    - you have to define the degree of the polynomial
                    - degree one is -> a*x+b
                    - the polyfit will return a value for a and a value for b
                - minimizes the sum of the errors
    - optimization problem
    - a line that best fits the objective function

- Linear regression:
    - doesn't have to be a line
    - can be for instance a parabola
    - R² -> coefficient of determination
    - R² = explainded variation/total variation
    or R² = 1 - (EE/DD)
        - EE -> errors in the estimation
        - DV -> data variance - the difference between the measured data and the mean of 
        the data
        - for example an R² = 0.9 means that 90% of the variations can 
        be explained by the model
        - the others 10% can be experimental errors or the existence of 
        lurking variables (variable that are not reflected on the model)
    - careful with over fitting the data
        - specially when you have complex models for a small sample
