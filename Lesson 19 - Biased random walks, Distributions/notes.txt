- biased random walks
- plot the data is a good way to understand and interpret 
that data
- focus on stochastic things

- always isolate decisions in small parts of the programs
- that makes easier to change things in the future
- a small bias can make a lot off difference after a given amount of time
- we should never ignore the data
    - we should explore the data and try to make sense out of it

- use an histogram to get a notion of the distribution of the data

- computer simulation
    - manhattan project
        - nuclear bombs simulation
        - nuclear detonation

- monte carlo simulation
- Generate a sample of representative scenarios
    - because we can't use exaustive enumeration to do them all

- the simulation will create a virtual device that act as the 
real one in important aspects

- simulations are:
    - descriptive not prescriptive
    - they describe the situation they don't tell the exact answer
    - optimization is for prescriptive approachs
    - for a starting point it will give you the consequences
