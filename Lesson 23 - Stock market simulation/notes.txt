- Texas sharpshooter fallacy
    - take the shots and then draw the target around those shots

- stock market simulation:
    - we can have either:
        - an indexed portfolio
            - own all of the stocks that there are
            - if the stock market goes up I win money
            - if the stock market goes down I loose money 
            - betting in the market as a whole
        - or a managed portfolio:
            - hire someone to manage in which stock markets to invest

    - the model to represent it:
        - efficient market hypothesis
            - the markets are informationally efficient
                - current prices reflect all publicly known
                information about each stock
                - and therefore are unbiased
                - if the stock is overpriced the people would sell and 
                the price would come down
                - if the stock is underpriced the people would buy and
                the price would come up
            - stocks are adjusted for risk
                - the more the risk, the more the fluctuation
            - so stocks have a distribution attached to them
        - what are the classes that I might want to have
            - stock
            - market

        - how to change the price:
            - in a multiplicative way
            - the change is related with the stock price
            - the other way would be to do an additive way
                - but this is for cases when the change doesn't have to 
                do with current value
        
        - is the price chcange really memoryless:
            - Poisson distribution
            - past behavior has no impact on future behavior
